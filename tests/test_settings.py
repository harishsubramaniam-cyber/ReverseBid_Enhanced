"""Settings: what a badly filled-in box does, and what the screen then says.

Two failures live here, both of which look like "the app is broken" to the
person running it:

* A setting typed into a hosting dashboard arrives as a *string*, and people
  leave boxes empty or paste "587 " with a space. Anything the app reads with
  int() used to bring the whole site down at startup with the reason buried in
  a deploy log. Nothing here may crash; a value that cannot be read falls back
  to the shipped default.
* The Outbox page used to tell everybody to edit a ``.env`` file. On Render,
  Railway or Fly there is no file to edit - the settings are typed into a
  dashboard - so that advice sent people looking for a file that cannot exist
  and their email never went. The page has to know where it is running.

Each case runs in its own subprocess, because settings are read once when the
app starts and that is exactly the behaviour being tested.
