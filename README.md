# ReverseBid_Enhanced — a reverse auction platform

A complete, self-contained reverse auction application: buyers publish a **ceiling** price,
invited suppliers compete by bidding **downwards**, and the lowest price wins. It covers the
whole cycle — onboarding, masters, auction creation, the live bidding engine, awarding,
reporting, and an email on every key event.

**What is enhanced.** Auctions can be decided on the **delivered price**, and the numbers come
from the people who actually know them. A bid is the **whole offer, sent in one go**: the
price, the **freight, packaging and other costs**, and the **taxes** as named percentages with
the amounts worked out for them. There is no bidding on the goods alone, and no leaving the tax
until later — a delivered-price auction will not take a bid without it. The board then ranks
everyone on what the buyer would truly pay: the bid, plus delivery, plus tax. The buyer never
has to guess a supplier's freight again.
The form follows how the auction will be handed out. **Item by item** means each item is bid
for on its own, with its own delivery costs and taxes, and the button names the item. **All to
one supplier** means the auction is bid for as one lot: every item priced on one form, delivery
quoted once for the consignment, and the ranking on the grand total.
Bidders can **take back their most recent bid** — only that one — and whatever they bid before
it stands again; and they can see **every bid they have placed**, with the prices and tax rates
exactly as they typed them and the moment each one went in.
Before awarding, the buyer can switch the whole screen between **the quotes as the suppliers
wrote them** and **what those quotes really cost delivered and taxed** — the two often disagree
about who is winning, which is exactly why both are shown.
The buyer also chooses **how the business is handed out** — item by item to each item's own
winner, or the whole auction to a single supplier — and the award screen shows **both totals
side by side**, so the cost of dealing with one supplier instead of several is a number on the
screen rather than a guess.
See **[docs/DELIVERED-PRICE.md](docs/DELIVERED-PRICE.md)** for the arithmetic and the choices
behind it.

Built with FastAPI + SQLAlchemy + SQLite and server-rendered HTML. No build step, no
JavaScript framework, one command to run.

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
python seed.py                      # optional demo data
uvicorn app.main:app --reload
# open http://localhost:8000
```

On Windows, double-click `windows-setup.bat` once and `windows-start.bat` thereafter.
**New to this?** `docs\1 - Running ReverseBid on Windows.docx` walks through it from installing
Python onwards, and `docs\2 - Putting ReverseBid on GitHub.docx` covers getting the code online.

Sample sign-ins (after `python seed.py`), password `demo1234`:

## What is built

**1 — Easy to adopt**

* Guided onboarding that explains the whole model in four steps.
* A **? Help** drawer on every screen and an **Ask** assistant, both in plain language.
  Every form field carries a one-line hint.
* Vendor, item and unit masters where only the obvious fields are mandatory — a vendor needs a
  name and an email, an item needs a name, a unit needs a code.
* Odoo-style inline create: add a vendor, item or unit from inside the auction form without
  losing your place.

**2 — Comparing like with like**

* **Delivered-cost comparison**, per auction. Tick *Compare on the delivered price* and the
  ranking, the decrements, the ceiling and the savings all work on the all-in figure, so the
  supplier next door and the one three states away are judged fairly.
* **The bid carries everything.** One form takes the price, the freight, packaging and other
  costs, and every tax as a named rate — sent together, checked together. Taxes are compulsory:
  a rate of `0` is a fine answer, but an empty box is not an answer at all. Amounts are never
  typed, only rates, so the money can never disagree with the percentage.
* **Item by item, or the whole lot** — whichever the buyer chose, that is what the bidder is
  asked for. Per item: its own costs, its own taxes, and a button that names the item. Whole
  auction: every item priced on one form, costs quoted once for the consignment, ranked on the
  grand total, and no partial baskets.
* Bidders still type their own ex-works price. Their screen shows a running all-in total as
  they type, and the exact price to type to take the lead — *"type ₹269.00 — that lands at
  ₹270.50"*. Each bidder's window is different, which is the point.
* **Take back the last bid, and only the last.** The bid before it stands again, at the figures
  it was sent with. The buyer keeps the power to strike out any bid at all.
* **Your bid record**, kept verbatim: every submission, newest first, with each price and tax
  rate as typed, the delivery costs, the totals, the exact time, and whether it is standing,
  replaced or withdrawn.
* Every bid keeps the delivered price it was ranked at, so no bid is ever re-ranked after the
  fact.

**3 — Documents, both ways**

* The buyer attaches drawings, specifications and terms to the auction or to **one item**, and
  every invited bidder can download them. Item documents show up beside that item on the
  bidding screen.
* Bidders attach their own paperwork — test certificates, datasheets, their terms — and **only
  the buyer** can see it. One supplier never learns what another sent.
* Only file types a procurement person actually sends are accepted; anything a browser might
  execute is refused, and downloads carry headers that stop them running as a page.

**4 — The auction engine**

* Creation and scheduling with editable start/end times until bidding opens.
* Starting price as a **ceiling** — no bid may sit above it — and it is **optional**: leave it
  empty and bidders open at any price, with savings measured from the highest bid received.
* Live rank (L1, L2, L3…) and lowest-bid visibility, each switchable per auction.
* **Minimum decrement** (how much lower each bid must be) and **maximum decrement**
  (the biggest drop allowed in one step), as a fixed amount or a percentage.
* Hidden bidder names — bidders see each other as “Bidder A”, “Bidder B”; the buyer always
  sees the real names.
* **Auto-extension**: a bid inside the closing window pushes the finish line back, with a
  configurable trigger, extension length and maximum number of extensions.
* **Give bidders more time**, by hand, while an auction is live: the closing time moves later
  and every bidder is emailed the new one. The clock only moves outwards — to finish sooner,
  **Close bidding now** does it immediately, and everyone is told either way.
* Editing a published auction emails the bidders **what actually changed** — the clock, the
  terms, the bidding rules, and any item whose quantity or starting price moved.

**5 — Award**

* **One bidder per item, for the whole quantity.** Different items can go to different bidders,
  or the whole auction to one — one click fills every line with the same supplier — but a single
  item is never carved up between two suppliers.
* Every line is pre-set to its L1; change the winner, change the price, or leave a line
  unawarded.

**6 — Reports and dashboard**

* Savings-first dashboard: total savings, baseline, awarded value, savings by month, closing soon.
* **Report 1 — Total Savings** across every auction decided in a date range — an auction
  counts in the period it was awarded or closed in, not the period bidding opened in.
* **Report 2 — Individual Auction Summary**: every bid — withdrawn ones included, flagged as
  such — the highest and lowest price, line-level savings (against the awarded price once the
  item is awarded) and the awardee.
* Both download as **PDF** and **CSV**.

**7 — Reach everyone, anywhere**

* Email on every key event: invitation, opening, bid received, outbid, extension, closing
  soon, closed, awarded, not awarded, cancelled and messages — with an in-app notification
  too for everyone who has a login (a bid confirmation is email only, since the bidder is
  looking at the screen already).
* You choose the recipients: several contacts per vendor, a per-auction override for one bidder,
  and a copy list for your own team. See **Who gets the emails** below.
* Outbid alerts that pull vendors back into the auction.
* Fully responsive — buyers and bidders can work from a phone browser, with a bottom nav bar.

**8 — Generic platform features**

* Private conversations between each bidder and the auction creator.
* An append-only audit trail on every action, visible on each auction.
* Publish goes straight to the bidders — no approval step. A future auction publishes as
  *scheduled* and can be opened early with **Start bidding now**; if the opening time has already
  passed, publishing opens it immediately.
* Bidders take back their most recent bid; buyers strike out any bid. Edit an auction before it
  opens, cancel with a reason at any time. Editing a
  published auction emails any bidder you add, and tells the rest what changed; cancelling a
  draft nobody was told about emails nobody.
* **Every failure is explained on the screen it happened on**, in plain words, with what you
  typed still in the boxes — never a raw error page or a wall of JSON.

**9 — Keeping it safe**

* Sessions are signed http-only cookies, marked secure automatically when `RA_BASE_URL` is
  https. With no `RA_SECRET_KEY` set, a random one is generated and kept in `data/secret_key`
  rather than falling back to a value published in the source.
* Every form carries a CSRF token, so another site cannot act using someone's session.
* Repeated wrong passwords are slowed down, per address and per computer.
* Bidding on one item is serialised, so two bids arriving together cannot both be checked
  against the same "current lowest" and both be accepted.

## How people get accounts

There is no supplier sign-up, by design. A supplier who registers themselves is connected to
nothing: no buyer has them on a vendor list, so there is no auction for them to see.

1. **The first account** is created at `/signup`. That page then closes itself.
2. **Suppliers** are added by the buyer as a vendor — a name and an email is enough. Every
   email that vendor's contacts receive carries a signed link that sets their own password and
   binds the new login to that vendor. They never choose which company they belong to, and the
   link works for `RA_INVITE_DAYS` (30 by default).
3. **Colleagues**, on either side, are invited from **Team** in the top bar. A supplier can only
   invite people into their own company; a buyer's invitation creates a buying account.

A vendor with no login still gets every email — and every one of those emails is a way in, not
just the first invitation.

## Who gets the emails

You control the recipients in three places, and the app always shows you exactly who will be
written to before anything goes out.

1. **On the vendor** — a vendor has a main address plus as many extra contacts as you like
   (their sales desk, a second contact, a shared inbox). Every one of them receives the
   invitation, the outbid alerts, the closing reminder and the award decision. Edit the list
   from **Vendors & items → Who gets the emails**, or when you first add the vendor — including
   from the inline “+ New vendor” box inside the auction form.
2. **On the auction, per bidder** — when you tick a vendor on the auction form a box appears
   underneath it. Type an address there and it replaces that vendor's usual list *for this
   auction only*, which is what you want when a different person handles one particular tender.
   Leave it blank and the vendor's own list is used.
3. **Your own copy list** — the “Copy my own team on this auction” box sends your colleagues
   (procurement head, finance) a copy when the auction is published, closed, awarded or
   cancelled. They need no login and never see the bidding screen.

Addresses can be separated by commas, semicolons or new lines, and `Name <a@b.com>` is
understood. Anything that is not a plausible address is refused with a plain-language message
rather than silently dropped. The **Details** tab of every auction lists the exact addresses each
bidder will be written to, and the **Outbox** shows what was actually produced.

Anyone with a login also gets the in-app alert, even when their address has been overridden for
that auction.

## Email

Email is real SMTP, with a safety net.

* Set `RA_SMTP_HOST` (and friends) and messages are genuinely sent.
* The **Outbox** page shows which server is in use and has a **Send test email** button that
  sends one message synchronously and reports the server's own answer — a wrong app password, a
  blocked port and a mistyped host each come back as a sentence saying what to change. No
  message is ever left at *queued* with no reason recorded, and **Try them again** retries
  anything that failed without a restart.
* Leave it unset and every message is written to `data/outbox/*.eml` **and** to the in-app
  **Outbox** page, so you can see exactly what a vendor would receive without sending anything.

Either way every message is logged in the `email_messages` table with its status. Sending happens
on a background thread, so a slow mail server never blocks a bid.

Gmail example (`.env`):

```
RA_SMTP_HOST=smtp.gmail.com
RA_SMTP_PORT=587
RA_SMTP_USER=you@gmail.com
RA_SMTP_PASSWORD=your-16-character-app-password
RA_MAIL_FROM=you@gmail.com
RA_BASE_URL=https://auctions.example.com
```

Copy `.env.example` to `.env` in the project root and restart — the app reads it on startup.
Real environment variables always win over the file, so a server configured through its own
environment (systemd, Docker's `--env-file`, a platform's settings panel) is unaffected.

---

## Configuration

All settings are environment variables — see `app/config.py`.

| Variable | Default | Meaning |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `RA_DATABASE_URL` | `sqlite:///data/reverse_auction.db` | Any SQLAlchemy URL; PostgreSQL works unchanged |
| `RA_SECRET_KEY` | random, saved to `data/secret_key` | Signs session cookies. **Set this yourself in production**, and always when you run more than one process |
| `RA_BASE_URL` | `http://localhost:8000` | Used for the links inside emails |
| `RA_TIMEZONE` | `Asia/Kolkata` | All times are stored in UTC and displayed here |
| `RA_CURRENCY` / `RA_CURRENCY_SYMBOL` | `INR` / `₹` | Display only |
| `RA_SMTP_*`, `RA_MAIL_FROM` | empty | See above |
| `RA_SCHEDULER_INTERVAL` | `5` | Seconds between clock ticks |
| `RA_MAIL_FROM_NAME` | `ReverseBid` | The name your emails appear to come from |
| `RA_ENDING_SOON_MINUTES` | `5` | When the “closing soon” alert goes out |
| `RA_MAX_UPLOAD_MB` | `10` | Largest document anyone can attach |
| `RA_MAX_ATTACHMENTS` | `30` | Most documents on one auction |
| `RA_INVITE_DAYS` | `30` | How long an invitation link keeps working |

## How it is put together

```
app/
  main.py          FastAPI app, routing, error pages
  models.py        the whole domain model
  engine.py        bid validation, ranking, auto-extension, savings maths
  scheduler.py     background clock: opens and closes auctions, time-based alerts
  mailer.py        SMTP with a dev-outbox fallback, background delivery
  notify.py        one function per event: in-app notification + email
  reporting.py     both reports, as HTML data, CSV and PDF
  help_content.py  every help string and the assistant's answers
  documents.py     attachments on disk: what is allowed, and how it is served
  emails_util.py   parsing and validating the address lists people type
  migrate.py       adds any new columns to an existing database on startup
  security.py      password hashing, sessions, role guards
  audit.py         the append-only trail
  errors.py        the two user-facing failure types, so routers can explain themselves
  routers/         one module per area of the app
  templates/       Jinja2 pages + the email template
  static/          one stylesheet, one small script
seed.py            demo data
docs/              the two step-by-step guides, as Word documents and markdown
tests/             end-to-end walk through a full auction
windows-*.bat      double-clickable setup and start, for Windows
```

Two design notes worth knowing:

* **The engine is pure.** `engine.py` never touches HTTP; the routers translate its
  `BidError` messages straight to the screen, which is why bidders get sentences like
  *“Too high. The current lowest bid is ₹35.23 and you must go at least ₹0.50 below it.”*
* **New columns migrate themselves.** `migrate.py` runs on startup and adds any column the
  model has and the database does not, so upgrading an existing installation is just a restart.
* **The assistant is offline.** `help_content.answer()` is a keyword matcher with no
  dependencies. Replace that one function with an LLM call and nothing else changes.

## Tests

```bash
python tests/test_end_to_end.py      # the happy path, end to end
python tests/test_hostile.py         # every way a person can get it wrong
python tests/test_regressions.py     # one check per bug ever found and fixed
python tests/test_features.py        # delivered cost, documents, invitations
python tests/test_scenarios.py       # the auction maths, proved with numbers
python tests/test_email.py           # sending, against a real SMTP server
python tests/test_organisations.py   # two buying organisations, and the wall between them
python tests/test_browser.py         # the screens themselves, in a real browser
```

The six suites below came out of the deep check — a round-by-round attempt to
break every part of the app, described in `docs/THE-DEEP-CHECK.md`:

```bash
python tests/test_enhanced.py        # delivered price, split-or-whole, the two views
python tests/test_bidding_rules.py   # the engine: the price offered is the price accepted
python tests/test_award_money.py     # every money figure on every screen, done by hand
python tests/test_access.py          # who can see what, across two companies
python tests/test_notifications.py   # every email: who gets it, and what is in it
python tests/test_forms.py           # everything people type, typed wrongly
python tests/test_upgrades.py        # new version over an old database, and races
```

They build a throwaway database and walk a whole auction: masters, inline create, publishing,
the scheduler opening the auction, every bidding rule (ceiling, minimum and maximum decrement,
not raising your own bid), visibility rules, withdrawal, messages, auto-extension, closing,
awarding one bidder per item, refusing an award to a bidder who never bid, savings maths,
all four report downloads, the audit trail,
the email outbox, and the three ways of choosing recipients.

**scenarios** pins the arithmetic: percentage and absolute decrements at their boundaries, ties
and ranking, withdrawal, fractional quantities, lines with no ceiling, awarding and re-awarding,
the extension cap, the scheduler's transitions, and the proof that the line savings add up to
the auction savings and to what the reports and the dashboard print.

**email** stands up a real SMTP server and breaks it every way a person's setup breaks — wrong
password, blocked port, unknown host, none at all — and insists each one ends up explained on
the screen rather than sitting at "queued". Install `aiosmtpd` for the live-server half; it
skips without it.

### Journeys

Each of these drives a real browser through what one person actually does, start to finish,
and fails on anything a person would notice — a page that errors, a button that does nothing,
a number that contradicts another number, a dead end with no way out. Every page visited is
watched the whole time for JavaScript errors, 4xx and 5xx responses, and crash text, not only
where a check happens to look.

```bash
python tests/test_journey_first_run.py   # the first hour with an empty install
python tests/test_journey_supplier.py    # invited supplier: email → password → bid → outcome
python tests/test_journey_buyer.py       # a buyer's day: watch, answer, close, award, report
python tests/test_journey_awkward.py     # double-clicks, Back, two tabs, phone, bad URLs
python tests/test_journey_landed.py      # back office, delivered cost, the clock moving
```

They need Playwright and Chromium:

```bash
pip install playwright && python -m playwright install chromium
```

Without them the journeys report that they are being skipped and pass, so CI without a browser
still works.

---

## Putting it online

`render.yaml` is a one-file blueprint: in Render, **New → Blueprint**, pick the
repository, press Apply. It comes up on a public address, already filled with the
demo company, with no mail server attached so nothing reaches a real inbox — a
link you can send to anyone who wants a look. `docs/3 - Putting ReverseBid
online.docx` walks through it click by click, and its last section covers the
three settings that turn the same deployment into a real one (a disk so nothing
is lost, `RA_DEMO_SEED=0`, and SMTP).

Two settings matter wherever you host it:

* **one worker.** The clock that opens and closes auctions runs inside the web
  process, so a second worker would run a second clock and email everyone twice.
* **`RA_TRUSTED_PROXIES`** — the number of proxies in front of the app (1 behind
  a single load balancer). Until it is set, `X-Forwarded-For` is ignored, because
  anyone can send it.

## Deploying

```bash
docker build -t reversebid .
docker run -p 8000:8000 --env-file .env -v $(pwd)/data:/app/data reversebid
```

Or anywhere that runs a Python web process:

```bash
uvicorn app.main:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000
```

For more than one worker process, move the database to PostgreSQL
(`RA_DATABASE_URL=postgresql+psycopg://…`) and run the scheduler in a single process, since each
worker would otherwise run its own clock.

Before going live: set `RA_SECRET_KEY`, set `RA_BASE_URL`, configure SMTP, and serve over HTTPS.
